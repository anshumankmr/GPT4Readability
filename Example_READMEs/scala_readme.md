Welcome to the documentation for the codebase of the `bijection` project by Twitter. This codebase provides a collection of utilities and libraries for performing conversions and transformations between different data types and structures. It aims to simplify the process of converting data in various formats, making it easier for developers to work with different data representations.

## Purpose and Functionalities

The `bijection` codebase offers the following main functionalities:

- Conversion between tuples and other data structures
- Buffering and serialization of data
- Integration with Clojure programming language

## Installation

To use the `bijection` codebase, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/twitter/bijection.git
   ```

2. Build the codebase using the provided build tools or build scripts.

3. Include the generated artifacts or libraries in your project's dependencies.

## Dependencies

The `bijection` codebase has the following dependencies:

- Scala
- Twitter Util
- Clojure

Please ensure that these dependencies are installed and available in your project before using the `bijection` codebase.

## Usage

The `bijection` codebase provides various utilities and libraries that can be used in different scenarios. Here are a few examples of how you can use the codebase:

1. Conversion between tuples and collections:

   ```scala
   import com.twitter.bijection.TupleBijections._

   val tuple: (Int, String, Boolean) = (42, "Hello", true)
   val list: List[Any] = tupleToList(tuple)
   ```

   In this example, the `tupleToList` function converts a tuple to a list.

2. Buffering and serialization:

   ```scala
   import com.twitter.bijection.Bufferable

   val data: String = "Hello, World!"
   val buffer: ByteBuffer = Bufferable.put(data)
   ```

   The `Bufferable.put` function serializes the data and stores it in a `ByteBuffer`.

3. Integration with Clojure:

   ```java
   import com.twitter.bijection.clojure.Workaround11770;

   Workaround11770.function0ToIFn();
   ```

   This example demonstrates the integration of `bijection` with Clojure, using the `function0ToIFn` function.

Welcome to the Bijection codebase! This repository contains a collection of Scala and Java code that is used to generate code for tuple bijections and injections, as well as bufferable tuples. It also includes a workaround for Clojure interoperability.

## Purpose and Functionalities

The codebase is primarily designed to generate code for tuple bijections and injections, bufferable tuples, and provide a workaround for Clojure interoperability. The main functionalities include:

- Generating code for tuple bijections and injections.
- Generating code for bufferable tuples.
- Providing a workaround for Clojure interoperability.

## Installation

As this is a codebase and not a package, it does not require a traditional installation. Instead, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/twitter/bijection.git
```

## Dependencies

The codebase requires the following dependencies:

- Scala
- Java
- Clojure

Please ensure these are installed and up-to-date on your system before using the codebase.

## Usage

The codebase is used to generate code for tuple bijections and injections, bufferable tuples, and provide a workaround for Clojure interoperability. Here is an example of how the codebase might be used:

```scala
val b = new StringBuffer
b.append("// Autogenerated code DO NOT EDIT BY HAND\n")
b.append(pkg).append("\n")

b.append("\ntrait GeneratedTupleBijections extends LowPriorityBijections {\n")
(2 to 22).foreach { cnt => b.append(implicitTuple(cnt)).append("\n") }
b.append("}\n")
```

In this example, a new `StringBuffer` is created and used to generate code for tuple bijections.
