## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use SpectralElements.jl:

1. Mesh Generation:

```julia
Ex = 2; nr1 = 8;
Ey = 2; ns1 = 8;

m1 = Mesh(nr1, ns1, Ex, Ey, [true, true])
```

2. Interpolation:

```julia
x = linspace(0, 1, 10)
y = sin.(2Ï€ * x)
xi = linspace(0, 1, 100)
yi = interp(xi, x, y)
```

3. Differentiation:

```julia
x = linspace(0, 1, 100)
y = sin.(2Ï€ * x)
dydx = deriv(y, x)
```

4. Solving PDEs:

```julia
function setIC!(u, x, y, t)
    u .= 0.0
    return
end

function setBC!(ub, x, y, t)
    ub .= 0.0
    return
end

function setForcing!(f, x, y, t)
    f .= 1.0
    return
end

setVisc!(Î½, x, y, t) = 1.0

it = 0
function cond(u, t, integrator)
    global it
    cond = (it % 100) == 0
    it += 1
    return cond
end

function affect!(integrator)
    global it
    u = integrator.u
    p = integrator.p
    t = integrator.t
    dt = integrator.dt
    # Perform necessary computations
end

u0 = zeros(100)
prob = ODEProblem(affect!, u0, (0.0, 1.0))
sol = solve(prob, Tsit5(), callback=cond)
```

Welcome to the SpectralElements.jl codebase! This project is a Julia package that provides functionalities for spectral element methods, a type of numerical technique used in the solution of differential equations. 

## Purpose and Functionalities

The SpectralElements.jl package is designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools for working with spectral element methods. The main functionalities of the codebase include:

- **Linear Algebra Operations**: The codebase reexports the LinearAlgebra and LinearSolve modules for performing various linear algebra operations.
- **Spectral Element Method (SEM) Building Blocks**: The codebase includes various files such as `jac.jl`, `interp.jl`, `derivMat.jl`, `semmesh.jl`, `semq.jl`, `ndgrid.jl`, and others that provide the building blocks for SEM.
- **Test Suites**: The codebase includes test suites for different components of the package, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the code.

## Installation

To install the SpectralElements.jl package, you can use the Julia package manager. In the Julia REPL, you can add the package by typing:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("SpectralElements")
```

## Dependencies

The SpectralElements.jl package depends on several other Julia packages, including:

- Test
- SafeTestsets
- Reexport
- LinearAlgebra
- LinearSolve
- UnPack
- Setfield
- Plots
- SparseArrays
- NNlib
- FastGaussQuadrature
- Zygote
- OrdinaryDiffEq
- Flux

## Examples of Usage

Here is an example of how to use the SpectralElements.jl package:

```julia
using SpectralElements, OrdinaryDiffEq, Flux
using LinearAlgebra,Plots

Ex = 2; nr1 = 8;
Ey = 2; ns1 = 8;

m1 = Mesh(nr1,ns1,Ex,Ey,[true,true])
bc = ['D','D','D','D']
M  = generateMask(bc,m1)
opM(u) = m1.Bi .* u
opB(u) = gatherScatter(mass(u,m1),m1)
```

In this example, we first import the necessary packages. Then, we create a mesh using the `Mesh` function. We generate a mask using the `generateMask` function and define two operations `opM` and `opB` using the `m1.Bi` and `gatherScatter` functions respectively.
