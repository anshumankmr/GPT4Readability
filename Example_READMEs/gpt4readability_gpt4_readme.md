Welcome to **GPT4Readability**! This tool is designed to automatically generate a README.md and suggest code improvements for any code repository. It's like having your own personal documentation and code review expert, available at any time! ðŸ˜ƒ

> Other than this sentence this readme file and this [suggestions file](https://github.com/loevlie/GPT4Readability/blob/main/suggestions.md) were both generated by GPT4Readability using gpt-3.5-turbo.  Any other changes made will be listed below:

* I added the version (0.0.8) to the installation section.
* UPDATE: README generation (suggestions coming soon!) is now integrated into [Huggingface Spaces ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/spaces) using [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio). Try out the Web Demo: [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JohanDL/GPT4Readability)

## Main Functionalities

1. **README Generation**: GPT4Readability can generate a comprehensive README.md file for your code repository, providing a clear and detailed overview of your codebase.
2. **Code Improvement Suggestions**: This tool can also suggest improvements to your code, helping you to optimize your codebase and adhere to best practices.

## Installation

GPT4Readability requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install GPT4Readability==0.0.8
```

## Dependencies

GPT4Readability requires the following Python packages:

- langchain
- openai
- faiss-cpu
- tiktoken

These dependencies will be automatically installed when you install GPT4Readability using pip.

## Usage

You can use GPT4Readability from the command line. Here's an example:

```bash
gpt4readability /path/to/your/code --function readme --output_readme MyREADME.md --model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

In this example, GPT4Readability will generate a README.md file for the code at `/path/to/your/code`, and the output will be written to `MyREADME.md`. The `--model` option allows you to choose between OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models.
