The CARLA ROS Bridge is a codebase that provides a bridge between the CARLA simulator and the Robot Operating System (ROS). It allows users to control vehicles in the CARLA simulator using ROS messages and receive sensor data from the simulator in ROS topics. The codebase consists of two main components: the CARLA ROS Bridge and the CARLA Ackermann Control.

## Functionalities

The main functionalities of the CARLA ROS Bridge codebase include:
- Establishing a connection between the CARLA simulator and ROS.
- Sending control commands to control vehicles in the CARLA simulator.
- Receiving sensor data from the CARLA simulator and publishing it to ROS topics.
- Enabling synchronous mode, where the ROS bridge waits for expected data from all sensors before proceeding to the next simulation step.
- Registering all sensors in the CARLA simulator or only the sensors spawned by the bridge.

## Installation

To install the CARLA ROS Bridge codebase, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/carla-simulator/ros-bridge.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies

The CARLA ROS Bridge codebase has the following dependencies:
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- CARLA simulator

## Usage

To use the CARLA ROS Bridge codebase, follow these steps:

1. Launch the CARLA ROS Bridge and CARLA Ackermann Control nodes:
   ```
   ros2 launch carla_ros_bridge carla_ros_bridge.launch.py
   ```

2. Customize the launch arguments as needed. For example, you can specify the role name of the ego vehicle, the control loop rate, the IP and port of the CARLA server, and more.

3. The CARLA ROS Bridge will establish a connection with the CARLA simulator and start publishing sensor data to ROS topics. You can now control the vehicles in the CARLA simulator using ROS messages.

## Overview

This codebase is designed to provide manual control for the CARLA simulator using ROS2 bridge. It includes several Python scripts that generate launch descriptions for different functionalities. The main functionalities of this codebase include:

- Launching the CARLA ROS bridge
- Launching the CARLA Ackermann control
- Configuring various launch arguments such as host, port, timeout, passive mode, synchronous mode, fixed delta seconds, town, and ego vehicle role name

## Installation

To install this package, you need to clone the repository and run the setup script. The package name is 'carla_manual_control'. 

## Dependencies

This codebase requires the following dependencies:

- Python
- ROS2
- CARLA Simulator
- launch
- ament_index_python.packages
- setuptools

## Usage

The main entry point of this codebase is the `generate_launch_description()` function. This function generates a launch description that includes various launch arguments and nodes. The launch arguments can be configured to control the behavior of the CARLA simulator and the ROS bridge. The nodes are used to launch the CARLA ROS bridge and the CARLA Ackermann control.

For example, to launch the CARLA ROS bridge with a specific host and port, you can modify the 'host' and 'port' launch arguments in the `generate_launch_description()` function.
