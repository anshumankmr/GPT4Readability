scrcpy is a powerful tool that allows you to display and control an Android device connected via USB or TCP/IP, directly from your computer. It provides a high-performance, low-latency screen mirroring experience, making it ideal for various use cases such as presentations, app development, and remote assistance.

## Functionalities

- Display and control an Android device on your computer screen
- Support for both USB and TCP/IP connections
- High-quality screen mirroring with low latency
- Control the Android device using your computer's keyboard and mouse
- Copy and paste text between your computer and the Android device
- Record the screen and save it as a video file
- Take screenshots of the Android device
- Control the device's rotation
- Show physical touches on the screen
- Turn the device screen off
- Support for audio mirroring (optional, requires working audio on the device)
- Support for multiple devices connected to adb

## Installation

To install scrcpy, follow these steps:

1. Clone the scrcpy repository:

## Overview

This codebase is for **Scrcpy**, a versatile tool that allows for the control of Android devices from a computer, using a USB connection or via TCP/IP. It provides display and control of Android devices connected on USB (or over TCP/IP). It does not require any root access. It works on GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS.

## Main Functionalities

- **Screen mirroring**: Display your Android screen on your computer in real-time.
- **Device control**: Control your Android device using your computer's mouse and keyboard.
- **Audio mirroring**: Mirror your Android device's audio to your computer (may not work on all devices).
- **Flexible rotation**: Set the initial display rotation.
- **Shortcut customization**: Specify the modifiers to use for scrcpy shortcuts.
- **TCP/IP configuration**: Configure and reconnect the device over TCP/IP.
- **Time limit**: Set the maximum mirroring time, in seconds.

## Installation

The codebase does not provide a direct installation method. However, it can be compiled and run from source. Please refer to the official [Scrcpy GitHub repository](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) for detailed instructions.

## Dependencies

The codebase requires the following dependencies:

- SDL2
- libavformat
- libavcodec
- libavutil
- libswscale
- libavdevice (optional, for audio)

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `--rotation` option:

```bash
scrcpy --rotation 2
```

This command sets the initial display rotation. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, and 3. Each increment adds a 90 degrees rotation counterclockwise.
